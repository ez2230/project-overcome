	Unfortunately, doxxers don't have to work very hard to find a victim's personal info. A number of free and paid services

	based on aggregated data from business directories, social media and other public records. With a specific target in mind, 
	all a doxxer has to do is search one or more of these services to find the details he or she wants."
