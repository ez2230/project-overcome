	take it to the authorities, they’re gonna wanna see this stuff, and the more you have the better." [ZQ1]_

WHO@:

	"Save everything: One of the first impulses many harassment victims have is to just delete any communications
	they've received, and that's a bad idea. It's important to save absolutely every communication you have with
	the harasser - email, chat logs, ICQ histories, anything. If the harasser has created a web site about you,
	save copies of it to your local system and have someone you trust who would testify in court for you if necessary
	to do the same. If you receive any phone calls from the harasser, have them traced immediately (your local phone
	company can tell you how to do that). If you receive any kind of postal mail or other offline communications,
	save them (with envelopes, boxes, etc.). Do not destroy any evidence - and do not handle it more than absolutely
	necessary or permit anyone else to do so. Immediately turn the evidence over to the police. Place envelopes,
	letters, etc. in plastic bags to protect any possible fingerprints." [WHO1]_
