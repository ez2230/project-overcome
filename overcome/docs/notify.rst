2. Who To Notify
================

In addition to online "verbal" abuse, threats and harassment, victims of :term:`doxxing` are also at
risk of offline harassment and identity theft which can result in real financial and reputational damage.
When researching a user during a doxxing, that user's Social Security Number(SSN) can often be discovered.
While this identifier was never intended to become a universal identifier for business and commerce, knowing
this vital bit of information plus personal details researched from a variety of sources can somtimes help
attackers gain access to otherwise secure accounts (see notes on `Spokeo <change.html#spokeo>`_, a site
popular with identity thieves and hackers).

Notifying the authorities and employers, financial institutions, and service providers **quickly** and
**clearly** can help reduce the damage footprint.


Authorities and Employers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Call your local police department (not 911), give them your address and ask them to watch for potential fake calls/reports
  (called :term:`SWATting` )
- Your employer. Victims have been let go from positions after bogus complaints/reports were called in by harassers.
  Let your employer know that this is happening and... (?)


Banks
~~~~~

Contact your bank via the identity theft or fraud departments, and inform them what's happening and request a *safe word* on the account.

Credit Cards/Credit Bureaus
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Start with the credit bureaus: The FTC has a guide on how to `Place A Fraud Alert
<http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0275-place-fraud-alert#How>`_ with one of the major credit bureaus.

    "Ask 1 of the 3 credit reporting companies to put a fraud alert on your credit report. They must tell
    the other 2 companies. An initial fraud alert can make it harder for an identity thief to open more
    accounts in your name. The alert lasts 90 days but you can renew it." [FTC]_

The guide has a helpful checklist to follow.

Medical Providers

Cell Provider

Reporting fraud/identity theft:

- AT&T, `Fraud Protection and Prevention <http://www.att.com/att/fraud/en/index.html>`_
- T-Mobile, `Identity Theft <http://www.t-mobile.com/company/privacyresources.aspx?tp=Abt_Tab_IdentityTheft>`_ (basically, see the FTC)
- Verizon, `Fraud Prevention <https://www.verizonwireless.com/fraud/>`_
- Sprint, `Clearing up identity theft <http://support.sprint.com/support/article/Clear_up_identity_theft/case-vw371511-20090922-111512>`_ (looks to be a hassle)
