3. What To Change/Secure
========================

When you are being harassed, or if you've been doxxed, there is a long list of things you can do to secure
your digital life and reduce the impact that harassers can have.

*Read all of Zoe's post, "What To Expect When You're Expecting (the internet to ruin your life)"* [ZQ1]_

Passwords
^^^^^^^^^

**Change Passwords**. **Change Passwords**. One more time: **Change Passwords**.

Think about how passwords are handled.

Use a password manager like 1Password or Lastpass, set passwords to more-than-8 characters, randomized
with upper and lower-case and numbers/punctuation.

Account Security Questions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    Zoe Quinn: "Change your security questions to something that isn't related to your personal life." [ZQ1]_

Email
^^^^^

    If you aren't using `Gmail <https://gmail.com>`_ consider starting. Google provides access over SSL (ie, HTTPS, use it) and it means your email is not sitting on your harddrive waiting to be hacked or stolen with your laptop.

Enable 2factor Everywhere
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Two-factor authentication means needing more than simply a password to login to any account where it is enabled.

    John Seggerson: "The idea is having not only a fixed password to log in (one factor), but a code which is either given to
    you or using a secret algorithm to generate a one-time code (second factor)." [SM1]_

`Two Factor Auth (2FA) <http://twofactorauth.org>`_ - List of websites and whether or not they support 2FA.

Lifehacker also has `a good article <http://lifehacker.com/5938565/heres-everywhere-you-should-enable-two-factor-authentication-right-now>`_ on enabling and using 2-factor authentication.

Spokeo
^^^^^^

**Remove yourself from Spokeo**: `Spokeo <http://spokeo.com>`_ crawls publicly available information
(including website profiles) about individuals and makes it completely searchable online by the individual's
name. This information includes current and previous addresses, phone numbers and other contact information.
Trolls can and do use this data to fuel harasssment campaigns.

    John Sileo: "Go to the [Spokeo] and look yourself up, then click on your name... once you have done that copy the
    URL in your web browser. Now, go to the bottom right of the page in small faded blue text, click
    privacy (third from the left). Once done, paste in the link you copied from the page you found
    yourself on and enter your email and the security code listed. This is a case where I would use
    a second email account (your designated junk-email account), not your main email to avoid the build
    up of possible spam emails that follow. It will then send you an email confirmation where you must
    click the URL to confirm removal.  Voila! You have been removed."

Social Media Sites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    Zoe Quinn: "Make your FB private. They will likely be trying to dig up whatever they can on you, real or
    imagined, and there’s no reason to leave stuff out there when you’re being creepily obsessed
    over. Make sure old posts get limited too - go to settings > privacy > limit past posts to
    do this." [ZQ1]_


Storage accounts (iTunes, Dropbox, Skydrive)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

EXIF/Photos
^^^^^^^^^^^

    Turn off or remove :term:`EXIF` data from your photos, if you are still posting.

    Uncommon Privacy: "Exif data contains a number of metadata tags about the photo such as the date and time it was taken, make and model of the camera, various camera settings and other information including GPS information.  Exif data is a risk because by sharing photos over the internet, you may be revealing personal information such as where you live, where you work or where your children go to school." [UP1]_

Domains
^^^^^^^

    Zoe Quinn: "Spend the $10 to hide your whois info off of your websites ahead of time if you can. This is
    a very common tactic." [ZQ1]_

    Any blog or site where a victim publishes is a likely target for :term:`DDoS` ing or defacement. It is
    especially important to enable :term:`whois` privacy for all owned domains, as a harasser can use a service
    like Bing's IP lookup to find all domains hosted on a given IP address.

    1. Ping ``yourblogdomain.com`` to get an IP address ``1.2.3.4``
    2. Search ``ip:1.2.3.4`` on Bing to get results for sites/domains with the same IP address ``yourbusinessdomain.com``
    3. Target ``yourbusinessdomain.com`` as well for attack.
