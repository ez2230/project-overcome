1. Reporting Threats of Violence
================================

**Step 1:** If you are receiving threats of violence, *do not hesitate to report them to the appropriate 
authorities*. Even if nothing comes from it immediately, it is wise to have an incendent report and case 
number if things escalate. Harassers will intimidate and dismiss reporting threats as "hysterics" -- *ignore 
them and report the threats*.

**Caveat:**

Twitter will not (as of this writing) review threat reports from third parties:

**WAM and Twitter**

`Women, Action and the Media <http://www.womenactionmedia.org/>`_ has created a 
`reporting form <https://womenactionmedia.wufoo.com/forms/wam-twitter-harassment-reporting-tool/>`_ where 
you can report harassment, threats etc on Twitter. These reports are checked by a human and then passed on
to Twitter:

    Just use the form below to tell us what's happening. If it checks out, we'll escalate it to Twitter 
    right away (24 hours max, hopefully much less than that) and work to get you a speedy resolution. 
    But please note: we're not Twitter, and we can't make decisions for them. We're going to do our best
    to advocate for you with them, though.
