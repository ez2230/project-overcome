Zoe Quinn:

	"Don't give yourself a hard time for feeling a certain way. It's a messed up position you've been put
	in and there’s no 'right" way to feel. You're not failing if it bothers you, you're not failing if
	you're angry, you are not failing for not being "tough enough". A lot of emotions come with these
	situations, and you're totally allowed." [ZQ1]_

	"Don't suffer alone. Make sure you reach out, and again, don't judge yourself. It's not weak to want
	or need help or to vent. There are so many women in the industry who understand what you're going
	through and would be happy to help however they can. If you have someone in person that can look after
	you, all the better. They'll remind you that what is happening to you is wrong, they will help make sure
	you're taken care of, and it's a huge huge asset." [ZQ1]_
