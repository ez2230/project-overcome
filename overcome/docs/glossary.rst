    DDoS
        Distributed Denial of Service attack - a website attack that uses large numbers of distrubuted
        agents (a botnet usually) to send massive amounts of website traffic, usually overloading and
        crashing the website's server and bringing it offline.

    Whois
        "WHOIS (pronounced as the phrase who is) is a query and response protocol that is widely used
        for querying databases that store the registered users or assignees of an Internet resource,
        such as a domain name, an IP address block" [WIKI1]_

    doxxing
        From *dox*, for *documents*. Finding and publishing documents with personal (but public)
        information about a target.

        "Doxing consists of aggregating as much information on an individual or organization
        using social media networks, web search engines, social engineering, basic deduction
        skills, and password cracking methods...

        Once enough information is gathered on a targeted individual or organization, the attacker
        openly publishes the target’s personal photos, personally identifiable information, and any
        other information, including information on family members, in retaliation for a perceived
        offensive action the target or the target’s organization may have taken." [NORRIS]_

    EXIF
       Digital image data stored in image files by cameras, scanners, smartphones and computers. Often
       includes time, date, and exact geographic location the photo was taken.

    SWATting
        "Swatting is the tricking of any emergency service (via such means as hoaxing
        a 9-1-1 dispatcher) into dispatching an emergency response based on the false
        report of an on-going critical incident" [WIKI2]_
