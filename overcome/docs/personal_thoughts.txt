Personal Thoughts
=================

I've never experienced any of this. I'm the last person to have an opinion or give advice. I'm just freshly leaerning about the damage that we cause to anyone not cut from the privileged white internet dude mold. I am trying to listen, closely and without judgement, to a lot of new voices.

I discovered the Internet 20 years ago and didn't realize until now that I hit the on-ramp to the HOV lane and haven't looked back. I wish I had paused to look around and help those whose experience online was not the libertarian utopia I was enjoying.
